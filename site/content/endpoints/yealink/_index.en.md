[pascom phone systems](https://www.pascom.net/en/ "pascom VoIP phone systems") are able to automatically and centrally configure Yealink IP phones. This process is known as Provisioning. For this purpose, pascom phone systems include a Default Configuration ({{< ui-button "Devices" >}} > {{< ui-button "Basic Configuration" >}}). For most deployment scenarios, these standard settings provide an ideal configuration. However, in some cases, the settings may need to be modified.

## Add New Phone

{{% tab "Cloud" %}}

Cloud provisioning allows you to set up the phones without having to configure them manually. The provisioning is done via the provisioning servers of the respective manufacturers. This all happens fully automatically.

{{< num 1 "Finding the MAC Address" >}}

MAC addresses can be found on the rear underside of the telephone.

Alternatively, the MAC address is often found on the product packaging.


{{< num 2 "Add Phones / Endpoints" >}}


Log into your pascom phone system and under {{< ui-button "Devices" >}} > {{< ui-button "Device list" >}} and press {{< ui-button "Add" >}} and select the option **IP Telephone: Manufacturer Yealink**.

![Add new Yealink Phone](add.en.png)  

Select a **display name** for the telephone.  

Under the corresponding field, enter the **Mac-Address** that you have just found and noted. 

For Provisioning, you still have to enter the **HTTP user** and the **HTTP password** of the phone. You can obtain the data from the respective manufacturer's manual.

### pascom Menu Key

Having been provisioned, the pascom menu key can be found on the second function key on the display of the Yealink IP phone. The following pascom phone system functions are available under this key:

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Telephone Book|Opens up the central pascom phonebook.|
|Journal|Displays answered, dialed and missed calls|
|Call Forwarding|Sets a call forwarding, activates / updates a previously configured call forwarding or deactivates an active call forwarding.|

### Accessing the Yealink Web UI

In order to access the web UI of your Yealink phone, you will need to know the phone's IP address. The following outlines the different methods of discovering the phone IP Address:

#### Finding the IP-Address on the Telephone

Press the **OK** key when the phone idle screen is active and the phone IP address, MAC Address and firmware will be displayed.

#### Finding the IP-Address via the pascom Web UI Device Listn

Log into the PBX Web UI and select the {{< ui-button "Devices" >}} > {{< ui-button "Device list" >}}, which provides you an overview of all available devices. To the left of each entry is an *Info* symbol which when clicked will open an overview of the provisioned telephone including the IP address.

### Function Keys

The function keys to the right and left of the Yealink phone's screen support a 3 page view, meaning they can be assigned with 3 different functions one for each page. Should the first page be fully assigned, the last key (bottom right) can be used to toggle pages.

#### BLF Key User / Extension Monitoring

Using the function keys, it is possible to monitor other extensions (i.e. users). The BLF keys (Busy Lamp Field) can be used to provide status information relating to the monitored extension. In this scenario, monitoring means watching the extension to see if the user is currently on the phone, being called or to answer calls intended for this extension (call pickup).

Function Keys can be assigned in a variety of ways.

#### Assign Function Keys Direct on the Yealink Phone

Push and hold the function key on the phone which you wish to configure for 5 seconds. At this point you will be able to assign this key with a function (e.g. BLF key).

|Settings|Assignment|
|---|---|
|Type|BLF|
|Account ID|Line 1|
|Label|Enter a name for the key.|
|Value|The extension to be monitored, e.g. 123 for the ext 123|

To confirm, press *Save*.

#### Assign Function Keys via the Yealink Web UI

Under the tab {{< ui-button "DSSKey" >}} it is possible to assign the various telephone keys as BLF keys for example:

|Type|Value|Label|Line|Extension|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BLF | The extension to be monitored, e.g. 123 for extension 123 | Enter an label / name for the key. | Line 1 | The extension number, i.e. 123 |

As well as user extensions, it is also possible to configure a BLF key with login codes or extensions switches.

#### Further Useful Function Keys

|Function Key|Description|
|---|---|
|**Speed Dial**| Can be assigned with a telephone number.|
|**DTMF**|Can be assigned with DTMF characters.|-->

### Default Configuration
    
As previously stated, Yealink IP phones are provisioned using the default configurations which can be found under {{< ui-button "Devices" >}} > {{< ui-button "Basic Configurations" >}}.
    
{{% notice note%}}
When modifying the default configuration settings, ensure you make a duplicate copy of the original using the {{< ui-button "Duplicate" >}} tool.
{{% /notice %}}
    
In addition, you can set an already edited default configurations as the {{< ui-button "standard settings" >}}. Doing so ensures that all newly added IP telephones will automatically be provisioned with these default configurations.

#### Assigning a Default Configuration

A default configuration can be assigned using multiple methods:

+ Via {{< ui-button "Devices" >}} > {{< ui-button "Basic Configurations" >}} > Choose your Basic configuration set and press {{< ui-button "Edit" >}} Under the {{< ui-button "Devices" >}} tab, it is possible to add multiple IP telephones.
+ Via {{< ui-button "Devices" >}} > {{< ui-button "Device list" >}} > Select and edit the IP Telephone and under the tab {{< ui-button "Basic Data" >}} choose the correct **Basic configuration** option.

#### Default Configuration & Automatic BLF Assignment

Under the {{< ui-button "Configuration" >}} tab, it is possible to modify the existing basic configuration. Under the **Keys** section you will find the already pre-configured function keys which provide a useful guideline to work with.

BLF Keys can be setup as follows:

    {{!-- keys --}}
    linekey.3.type = 16
    linekey.3.value = 123
    linekey.3.label = Max
    linekey.3.line = 1

The assigned key (in this case, line key 3) consists of three parameters:

+ *type*: The key type, 16 stands for BLF,
+ *value*: the value, in this case the extension number,
+ *label*: the label, which is to be displayed on the phone's screen Label.
+ *line*: the account of the user who is logged in to the telephone and is performing the configuration. *(selected line must always be 1)*

Via the menu tab {{< ui-button "Devices" >}}, assign these default configurations to thoses telephones that should be configured with this BLF setup. Save and apply your changes and once the phones have restarted, the changes will have taken affect.

### Firmware Updates

From mobydick version 7.14 onwards, IP endpoint firmware will no longer be included as standard. Should a firmware version (other than the version pre-installed on the phone) be required, this must be externally sourced and per hand uploaded to the phone system firmware management tool.

#### Upload New Firmware

The desired firmware can be uploaded via the the {{< ui-button "Devices" >}} > {{< ui-button "Device firmware" >}}:

|Settings|Description|
|---|---|
|Firmware Files|Upload the firmware files here. Firmware can be found here: [Yealink support download page](http://support.yealink.com/documentFront/forwardToDocumentFrontDisplayPage).|
|Model|Yealink Telephone model name|
|Version|Firmware Version|
|Comments|Optional field for notes|

#### Firmware Roll Outs

Firmware updates can be roll out via the {{< ui-button "Devices" >}} > {{< ui-button "Device list" >}} menu. Simply select the desired Yealink Endpoints from the list via the check boxes and under {{< ui-button "Actions" >}} > {{< ui-button "Roll out firmware" >}}. This will open an overview of all selected devices to which the new firmware version should be roll out to. Click {{< ui-button "Firmware Update" >}} to roll out the desired firmware version.
