## VoIP and network quality that can be measured

In order to ensure secure communication, it requires a well-coordinated network. To keep an eye on your network, Nextragen helps you with
permanent network monitoring.


### Instant overview of network quality

The quality of a network can only be measured with meaningful reports. The documentation of the network must contain the most important information for each customer in order to react
dynamically to fluctuations in the network and to optimize it.

Defined rules, alarms and actions enable the detection of bottlenecks in the network and a corresponding reaction. If the measuring system detects even slight deviations of the predefined network quality, individual actions such as email notifications or the start of correction applications are carried out. This allows a decisive reaction even before noticeable quality losses occur. 

### Measurement and Simulation

The Nextragen Solutions measurement technology analyses the calls running in the network for different network parameters such as jitter, packet loss etc. and is also able to evaluate
the voice quality end-to-end.

Additionally, with the traffic simulator TraceSim, conversations can be generated to test different scenarias. This is ideal for simulating call peaks during certain business hours.
