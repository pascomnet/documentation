## Overview

Deutsche Telekom package specifications and tariff information can be found [here](https://geschaeftskunden.telekom.de/startseite/festnetz-internet/tarife/333506/deutschlandlan-sip-trunk.html). pascom phone systems (classic and cloud) support only Deutsche Telekom business tariffs.  

{{% notice warning %}}
pascom phone systems only supports direct SIP account registration in combination with the Deutsche Telekom [recommended Lancom Router](https://geschaeftskunden.telekom.de/startseite/festnetz-internet/tarife/354892/paket-zum-anschluss-einer-ip-telefonanlage.html) when connecting an IP PBX. Alternatively, it is possible to perform the [registration on the router]({{< relref "#setup-via-fritz-box">}}) .<br/><br/>
Should you use your own router, this must in principle comply with the criteria as the devices recommended by Deutsche Telekom.  However, in such as scenario, pascom are not able to offer any support for the configuration.

## Setup

If you use a Fritz!Box in your network setup, you can setup your Deutsche Telekom connection there. Click [here]({{< relref "#setup-via-fritz-box">}}) for our setup guide.
If you do not use a Fritz!Box, then please setup your Deutsche Telekom trunk directly within your pascom phone system and *not on your router*.

### Setup in pascom 

#### Router preparation

Before beginning with the Deutsche Telekom trunk setup within your pascom phone system, please make sure that the following settings have been configured on your router:

1. SIP-ALG must be deactivated.
2. The Deutsche Telekom trunk must no be setup on the router or must be deactivated.

Having checked the above, you can continue with adding the Trunk via the pascom phone system admin Web UI.

**Example Setup:**

The following screenshots were created using a *LANCOM R883VAW (over ISDN)* with the Firmware 10.00.0170.

The SIP-ALG settings are found on the LANCOM router Web UI under {{< ui-button "Configuration" >}} > {{< ui-button "SIP-ALG" >}} > {{< ui-button "General" >}}.
Uncheck the "SIP-ALG activated" box.

![LANCOM SIP-ALG Settings](/lancom_sip_alg.de.png?width=70%)

The trunk configuration is found within the LANCOM router web UI under {{< ui-button "Configuration" >}} > {{< ui-button "Voice Call Manager" >}} > {{< ui-button "Lines" >}} > {{< ui-button "SIP Lines" >}}.
Makes sure that these settings are either empty or deactivated.

![LANCOM SIP-Lines](/lancom_sip_lines.de.png?width=70%)

#### Completing the Trunk Template

Add a new Deutsche Telekom trunk under {{< ui-button "Gateways" >}} > {{< ui-button "Trunks" >}} > {{< ui-button "Add" >}}, which directs you the the SIP provider database. Using the filter, you can search directly for *Deutsche Telekom* templates. Select the *Deutsche Telekom SIP Trunk* template and add your account data / credentials to the template setup wizard.

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|**Name**|Enter a name for the trunk, which will be displayed in the Trunks overview.|
|**Telephony username**|Use the telephony username from your registration data.|
|**Telephony password**|Enter the corresponding password.|
|**Number of registration**|Registration phone number (Registrierungsrufnummer) as found in the registration data.|
|**Area code**|Enter your area code (Ortskennzahl / Ortsvorwahl) excluding the leading 0, e.g. *991*.|
|**Originating number**|Telephony connection base / line number (Stammnummer) excluding extension number block e.g. the number displayed as *XXXXXX* in our example.|
|**Prefix for incoming number**|Any digit which should precede all incoming calls via this trunk. For example entering 0 will mean that all inbound call numbers will be displayed in the call logs on IP Phones as 00172123123 instead of 0172123123. This enables the direct call back from the call history via this trunk.|
|**Number of extension digits**|The digit length of User Extensions - NOT the number of digits in the number block|
|**Extension for central**|Enter the internal extension number to which calls to the first number of your number block (normally 0) should be routed, i.e. to the switchboard / reception / AutoAttendant.|


After pressing {{< ui-button "Save" >}} the trunk will be added. Doing so will automatically add default call rules, which can then be adapted according to your requirements. For more please read the following article on [Call Rules]({{< ref "trunks/rules">}}).

#### Update Password

Go to {{< ui-button "Gateways" >}} > {{< ui-button "Trunks" >}} and select the required trunk and press {{< ui-button "Edit" >}}. Under the {{< ui-button "Account" >}} tab you can change your password by doubling clicking on the desired field under the {{< ui-button "Password" >}} column. Confirm the changes by pressing {{< ui-button "Ok" >}} and save and apply the new settings via the {{< ui-button "Save" >}} and then finally the apply telephony configurations.

### Adding Additional Deutsche Telekom SIP Accounts

Should you wish to extend your Deutsche Telekom DeutschlandLAN SIP-Trunk connection by adding an additional account, add the new account in the existing Trunk configuration under the {{< ui-button "Accounts" >}} tab. Since the default settings (basic settings) are the same for both accounts, all you need to do is highlight the account and press the {{< ui-button "duplicate" >}} button. In the new account row that will appear, you can now adapt the settings by adding the new **Username** (i.e. *Registrierungsrufnummer*), the **password** and the **Auth_User** (i.e. the *telefonie-Benutzernamen*) as well as updating the other fields to match your needs.

Next, the [inbound and outbound call rules]({{< ref "/trunks/rules">}}) must be modified. By the outbound rules you will need choose which account should be used per rule. Scroll to the right and under the {{< ui-button "Account" >}} column choose the desired account.

### Setup via Fritz!Box

In the following scenarios, we recommend registering your Deutsche Telekom trunk via a Fritz!Box:

* A Deutsche Telekom trunk will be registered that is not a business tariff.
* The SIP Account registration to the provider occurs via a VLAN, in which the pascom phone system cannot access.

{{% notice warning %}}
When using a Fritz!Box, the connection is limited to two voice channels due to the Fritz!Box firmware.
