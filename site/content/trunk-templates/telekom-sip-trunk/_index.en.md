### Adding Additional Deutsche Telekom SIP Accounts

Should you wish to extend your Deutsche Telekom DeutschlandLAN SIP-Trunk connection by adding an additional account, add the new account in the existing Trunk configuration under the {{< ui-button "Accounts" >}} tab. Since the default settings (basic settings) are the same for both accounts, all you need to do is highlight the account and press the {{< ui-button "duplicate" >}} button. In the new account row that will appear, you can now adapt the settings by adding the new **Username** (i.e. *Registrierungsrufnummer*), the **password** and the **Auth_User** (i.e. the *telefonie-Benutzernamen*) as well as updating the other fields to match your needs.

Next, the [inbound and outbound call rules]({{< ref "/trunks/rules">}}) must be modified. By the outbound rules you will need choose which account should be used per rule. Scroll to the right and under the {{< ui-button "Account" >}} column choose the desired account.


{{< num 3 "Does your Trunk work?" >}}

To make sure that your data has been entered correctly and that the pascom PBX has successfully registered with your provider, click on the {{< ui-button "Gateway" >}} - {{< ui-button "Trunks" >}} on the {{< ui-button "Info Symbol" >}} at your trunk.
Here you can see if the **registration** has worked. (*registered*).
