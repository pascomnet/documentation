## Setup Mobile Acces via the Internet (optional)

{{% notice note %}}
If you want to use this feature, follow these steps now. Future changes are possible, but will result in changes for your users as aspects such as access to the server via the pascom client will change from a local IP address to a DNS name. 
{{% /notice %}}

This step is required should you wish to use the pascom mobile client (iOS/Android) or desktop client to access the local pascom server from "on the go" i.e. outside of the network. 

 * See [Setup Mobile Acces via the Internet]({{< ref "howto/mobile-access" >}})
