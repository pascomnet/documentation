This step is required should you wish to use the [pascom desktop and mobile Unified Communications apps](https://www.pascom.net/en/business-phone-system/unified-communications/ "pascom UC business phone systems") (Windows/Mac/Linux and iOS/Android) to access the local pascom server from "on the go" i.e. outside of the network.
