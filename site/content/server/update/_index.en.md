## Restart pascom

{{% notice warning %}}
During the phone system restart and installation process, telephony services will not be available and all active calls will be disconnected. Therefore, never perform a system restart while the system is in use.
{{% /notice %}}

The installation of updates is done only when the phone system has been restarted.
To perform a restart, click {{< ui-button "System" >}} > {{< ui-button "Restart" >}}

As soon as the update has successfully finished, the host with the new server version will be listed under {{< ui-button "System" >}} > {{< ui-button "Firmware" >}}.

### Firmwares | OS-A and OS-B

The pascom system has a firmware cluster module, which can easily switch back to the previous version in the case of update problems. During an update, the OS that is not currently started is selected. If the update is successful, the updated OS version is started automatically and the previous one is ended, which is then used for the next update.

**What to do if an update fails?**

1. Connect your hardware appliance to a monitor + keyboard. (Virtualized mostly already available)
2. Restart the whole System under {{< ui-button "System" >}} > {{< ui-button "Restart" >}}.
3. At the beginning of the boot process you can select OS-A or OS-B, which will then be loaded.
4. You can then easily start the update again.

## System Backup
### Backup via the pascom Server Management Interface (Onsite only)

On the **pascom Server Management** interface, you can access the {{< ui-button "Phone Systems" >}} of your telephone instance via {{< ui-button "Details" >}}, where you will first find an overview of your backups.

1. Click **Create** and a full backup of your system will be generated.
2. Manage your backups by downloading the backupfiles via the **link** in the file name, or removing them using the **trashcan symbol**.
