## pascom Groups

Groups in pascom provide an excellent Team Collaboration tool where you can quickly and dynamically create a place for people to communicate and collaborate with one another. pascom groups can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as projects, presentations and conferences. Imagine pascom groups like virtual conference rooms.

### Create a pascom Group

First you will need a pascom group. Create a new group using the following [Tutorial]({{< ref "/client-desktop-userguide/pascom-groups">}}). Tip: There are no limitations on how many groups you can create, so you can add as many groups as you like / require on the pascom system.

### Make pascom Groups Public

In order to provide external participants access to a group, the group must be made public. Click the **info symbol** within the group which will take you to the administration settings. Switch the **Allow guests** button to **on** in order to make the group "public". This "public" status will also be displayed respective group's entry in the contact list.

A **dial-in number, PIN and URL** for the pascom WebRTC web client access will now be generated and displayed.


|Fields|Description|
|---|---|
|Dial-in-Number|Participants can access the conference by phone using the pascom Web Client's dial-in number.|
|PIN|The PIN is required to participate in the conference using the dial-in number.|
|URL|Link to the pascom Web Client to access the group web meeting.|
|Copy Invitation to Clipboard| Copy all details to the clipboard for sharing all access information with the intended participants.|

As soon as a group is public, external participants can log in to the group using the dial-in / access data. But don't panic, only moderators can actually start web conferences.

## The Moderator

Internal users of the pascom system are referred as moderators. Every internal user who participates in a public conference is also a moderator. If a moderator dials into a public conference, the conference will automatically start for all externally logged in participants. If the last moderator leaves a public conference, the conference will then be set to **hold**.
As soon as external participants log into a conference and wait for the conference to start, you will see this in the contact list for the relevant group as the group will turn green.

Several internal users can also participate in a web conference, all of them acting as moderators. For example, when holding a presentation you can let other moderator users answer questions in the chat at the same time.

### Start a Conference

As soon as you are ready to start the web conference, join the group by dialing in by clicking the green **phone symbol**. 

### Manage a Conference

As a moderator, you have full control over the conference. In the call area you can see all participants in the conference and can interact with them. You still have all the phone and video tools you need to give great online meetings or presentations. 

![participants](participant_list.en.PNG?width=80%)

You can still use your pascom chat tools to chat with  all participants and manage settings for the group.

This will not completely end the web conference, but rather places it on hold. External participants will be directed to a waiting screen. So after a short break, you will be able to restart the web conference again.
