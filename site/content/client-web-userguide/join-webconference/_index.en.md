As an external participant in an audio conference, you will usually receive dial-in data consisting of a phone number and PIN.

```
Dial in Number: +499912969166
PIN: 313 787 136

```
As soon as you have dialed in via the dial-in number and entered the PIN, the pascom phone system will direct you to the corresponding conference. To end the audio conference, simply hang up.

### Participate in a Web Conference

As an external participant in a web conference, you will usually receive an invitation that can look like similar to below.

```
Group: "Demo Group"
Webclient URL: https://pascom.net/pascom/webclient/f791b39a-4fd4-431b-850a
Dial in Number: +499912969166
PIN: 313 787 136

```
Enter the URL into to your browser and navigate to the pascom web client's web conference start page.

### The Waiting Area

If a participant joins a web meeting before a moderator has started the conference, the waiting area will always appear. This is also the case if a moderator chooses to pause a conference.
