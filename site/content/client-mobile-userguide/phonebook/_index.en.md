## Overview


The pascom phone book is designed to contain a company-wide global phone book and a private phone book for each individual user. This prevents users from storing their private data in the company phone book. System administrators and phone book administrators take care of global phone book entries and you can manage your own records. 

1. *When an incoming call is received, the system first searches for a matching contact in your private or mobile phone book. If the system does not find it, it will search the global company phone book for a matching entry. So you can overwrite company entries with your private data and only you can see this data.* 

## Open the Phonebook

Click on the **Phone Book** icon in the menu bar to open up the telephone book.

As you can see in the above graphic, there are **colored** and **greyed** symbols that indicate whether the corresponding contact type contains data or not. 

## Details of an Phonebook entry

Each contact in the phone book contains additional information. Click on a **phonebook entry** and you will get to the **detail view**.

If you have the role of **Phone book administrator** or if you are in a telephone book entry of your private telephone book, you can edit the telephone book entry on the top right of the **Edit icon**. 


## Add phone book entries to contact list

If you want to place contacts from your phonebook directly in your **contact list**, you must mark the corresponding **phonebook entry** as **favorite**.
