## Overview

In order to log on to the pascom Mobile Client, the pairing process must first be carried out once. Simply, the pascom Mobile App must couple with the Desktop Client. This can be done by the system administrator or, with the necessary permissions, by yourself.


## The Pairing Process

Start the pascom Desktop Client and go to the **Client Settings**

1. Open the **Client Settings** via the pascom menu.

Your **private** mobile phone number is required to use the **GSM fallback**. If you do not have an active WLAN connection, the pascom Mobile Client establishes a connection via the cell phone network.
