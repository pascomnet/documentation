### pascom Groups with Audio, Video and Chat

Further enhance team collaboration with team messaging / team chat. Building on our “on the fly” group chat, with pascom 19 it is now possible to add “always-on” team messaging channels. Break down information silos by grouping users into departments, teams or projects and enable them to brainstorm ideas, share files and dynamically start audio / video conferences and desktop sharing sessions.

## Breaking Changes

{{% notice changes %}} 
This section explains the changes that you must consider when migrating to pascom 19
{{% /notice %}}

* **Snom Pickups** where changed to `EXTENSION|*8` syntax. See [Snom Desktop Phones]({{< ref "/endpoints/snom#function-keys" >}}).
* **Trunk Failover** deleted without alternative tools. No migration and no direct workaround. Support can help with an outbound script, if needed.   
* **IAX trunks** deleted without alternatives.   
* **Swap** is now disabled by default. This can break virtualised setups with memory lower then 1 GB, please configure more memory in this case.  
* **Call groups** are automatically converted to teams. The callgroup feature has been removed and customers should configure teams instead.  
* Port forwarding for **UDP 3478** is now mandatory, otherwise **video** tools will not work.
* A new provisioning is required for **beronet Gateways**.
* **pascom SOHO Server** is no longer compatible. Please perform a hardware upgrade to the [pascom Appliance]({{< ref "server/appliance" >}}) or use the pascom.cloud.
* **Automatic Trunk Updates** will be performed for Telekom, peoplefone (DE, AT, CH), HFO, Sipgate Trunking, RKom, t-m-net, sipcallch, seabix, mnet, easybell and qsc/plusnet. Please check your trunk after update.
* **Cronjob Scripts (before/after)** are no longer supported
* Tunks which have their **own template**, get this automatically assigned again. All customizations using a generic template are removed
* After the update, the **Provisioning URL for generic IP endpoints** need to be reset! Existing, duplicated generic Base Configurations will need to be updated to match the REGEX pattern of the new Standard Base Configurations ("/provisioning/v1-[0-9a-zA-Z] {16} /?$").
* **Queuemetrics** must be re configured.
* With this update, **static conference rooms** will be deleted without being migrated!
* **Clients older than Version 65** will no longer be able to connect to this server.
* **Snom M700 3X firmware** is no longer supported.
* **CDR Rest API** has a new data structure and any implementations must be adapted.


## Known Issues

{{% notice issues %}}
These problems are known to us and we are already working on a solution
{{% / notice%}}

* Onsite Telekom trunks only work if an outbound proxy is used. To do this, select the appropriate interface in the trunk instead of "default / NAT".
