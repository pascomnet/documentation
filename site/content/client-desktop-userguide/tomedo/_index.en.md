## New incomming Call


When a new incoming call is received, you will receive a **PopUp message** from the pascom client, in which you can answer your patient's call.
You can already open the caller's patient data records before you **answer** the call via the {{{< ui-button "Action - Button" >}}.

## Active Call

As soon as you answer the call, tomedo® opens the caller's patient data and sets corresponding entries in the telephone history.

You can start calls directly from tomedo®. To do this, click on the **phone symbol** of a patient.
