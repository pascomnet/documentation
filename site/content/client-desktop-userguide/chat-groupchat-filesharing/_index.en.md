## Chat with colleagues

Quickly exchanging information with a colleague has become an indispensable tool in business communication today. In the pascom client, simply click on a colleague in the {{< ui-button "contact list">}} to open the chat conversation window.

Alternatively, during an active phone call with your colleague, you can simultaneously open the chat conversation by clicking on {{< ui-button "chat">}} in the **Call element**.

### Type a Chat message

1. Enter your message in the lower {{< ui-button "input field">}} and send the message by clicking on the {{< ui-button "red send arrow">}} or by pressing the **enter key**.

2. If you want a paragraph in the chat message, press **Shift + Enter key** to insert a blank line.

## Group chat with several colleagues

For group chat rooms you first need a pascom group which you can create with the following [tutorial]({{< ref "/client-desktop-userguide/pascom-groups" >}}).

Click on the {{< ui-button "group">}} in your contact list to open the chat conversation.

1. Type your message as usual in the {{< ui-button "input field">}}  and send it by clicking on the {{< ui-button "red send arrow">}} or by pressing the **enter key**.

## Close a Chat

1. Close the current chat conversation by clicking on the {{< ui-button "red x icon">}}in the upper right corner. 

{{% notice info %}}
If you close a chat conversation and have already written a message but have not yet sent it, the pascom client saves what you have already written and you can continue editing it later. This allows you to jump back and forth between chat conversations.

## Chat Notifications

If the conversation area is not in focus and you receive a new message, a notification message appears in the **contact list** at the **profile picture** and at the respective **contact**. The profile picture always shows you the complete, not yet read, messages. Contacts with new messages will automatically move up in the contact list, if the sorting is set that way.

## Send Files (Filesharing)

The client offers you the possibility to exchange files with your colleagues. This also works during an active call without having to hang up the phone. 

There are several ways to send a file to your colleague.  

1. Click on the {{< ui-button "red paper clip">}} in the current chat conversation and select the file you want to send.

### Useful tips for file transfer

1. Where can I find my downloaded images and files?
</br>
In the **Download folder** of the operating system.

2. What is the maximum file size?
</br>
**File size max. 100 MB**.

3. Why do images not have the original resolution?
</br>
Images are compressed during transmission to speed up data transfer. If you want to send your colleagues images in the **original resolution**, you must compress the image beforehand with a **ZIP program**.

4. Why do transparent PNG images have a black background in the preview?
</br>
Due to compression, **transparent PNG images** are converted to a smaller **JPG image format** for the preview image in the pascom client. **DON'T WORRY**: Download the image to your computer, it will have its original format.
