## Video telephony with your colleagues

Whether in the home office or in virtual meetings, the visual element of a video Call promotes better collaboration. This requires an installed or integrated webcam, which you must select in the [Client Settings](link to settings). Usually the webcam is found automatically by the pascom client, so you do not need to worry about it. 

### Start a Video Call

Call your colleague as usual. During the **active call** you now have the option to activate the **video function** in the **dialing field** with one click.

By default, the video call with your colleague starts in full screen mode.

### Screensharing during an active Video Call

Turn on screen sharing during an active video call to share your screen content.

### End a Video Call

To end the video call, hang up the call using the **red handset button**.

## Use Screensharing

Quickly sharing screen content with colleagues makes team collaboration in everyday life much more efficient. Above all, both participants can visually understand what is being discussed. A great feature.

### Start Screensharing

Call your colleague as usual. During the **active call** you now have the option to activate the **screensharing function** in the **dialing field** with one click.
