## What are pascom Groups?

Think of pascom groups as dynamic conference rooms with a lot of additional features. pascom groups can be used as chat rooms, but can also be upgraded to audio and video conference rooms.
For example, create a **"support group"** for all support staff, where they can exchange information in group chat and hold audio and video meetings.

With the group function you create permanent groups for:

1. Group chat
2. Audio conferences
3. Video conferences
4. Online meetings with screen sharing
