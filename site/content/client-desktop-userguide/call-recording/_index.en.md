## Ãœbersicht


Call recording is a good tool for improving customer service. Recorded calls can be evaluated and analyzed at a later date. 

1. *The recording system can run in the background without your intervention. Call recordings can also be started manually during an active call. In this case, inform your conversation partner that you are authorized to record conversations and whether the caller agrees to the recording.*

The recording system can only be used by users with the appropriate authorization during an active call. Therefore, please speak to your system administrator.
