## Overview

The Desktop client consists of three main components:

+ On the left hand side of the client, you will find your profile section, UC tools menu and contact list.
+ The right hand side is dedicated to telephony functions
+ The middle section is a fluid content area that changes depending on which UC tool is currently being used, i.e. Instant Messaging (Chat), Call History or Phone Books.

![Client Expanded Mode](expanded_mode.en.png)

The desktop client also offers differing view modes:

+ **Expanded Mode**: Displays all three components, of which the middle section can be selected using the UC tool toggle list.
+ **Normal Mode**: The user profile and contacts are visible as well as it being possible to switch between the *Chats, Telephony, Call History,* and *Phone Book* tools.
+ **Mini Mode**: Only a single area is visible and the UC tools menu is now found under the content area. Using the menu tool, it is possible to navigate through all UC tools, changing the visible content area as you go.

![Client Normal and Mini Mode](normal_mini_mode.en.png)

In order to simplify switching the various views, it is possible to toggle the sizes using a [shortcut key]({{< relref "#shortcut-keys">}}) if you choose to.

## Profile and Contacts List

![My Profile](profile.en.png?width=90%)

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Presence Status|It is possible to update your presence status with the following options:<br>- *Green* > Available<br>- *Yellow* > Away<br>- *Red* > Do Not Disturb / Busy (This option doesn't deliver DND functionality.)<br><br>Status texts can be customised according to requirements - simply select the correct presence and then click on the status text and replace it.|
|Create new group|With the "+ symbol" you can create a new permanent team messaging / chat group.|
|Contact list filter|Filter contacts to display only certain contacts. Per default, two filters are available as standard - *Favourites* and *Teams*. Favourites can be added by clicking on the star symbol next to a contact's handset icon. Additional filters can be defined by the system administrator using [Roles]({{< relref "/user/role">}}).|
|Contacts |[Contact list]({{< relref "#Contacts">}}) displaying contact presence, extension and contact information.|
|Phone Symbol |Click on the phone symbol to call the contact.|
|Favourite Symbol|Simply mark your favourite contacts with the "star" symbol. These are then pinned at the top of the contact list.|
|Teams | Under [Teams]({{< relref "#teams">}}) you will see all the teams of which you are either a permanent or dynamic member. The *Available* or *Offline* status signify whether you are currently logged into a team or not.|


## Contacts

Each contact in your contact list has various statuses, which can be seen in the following illustration.

![Contacts](contacts.en.png?width=90%)

## Teams

![Teams](teams.en.png)

The teams function can be used to gain an overview of what's happening in the teams of which you are a member of. The teams tool also enables you to dynamically log in / out of a team (if your are a dynamic member), pause / resume your team membership as well as seeing the status of other team members / queue agents and seeing any calls currently waiting in the queue.

## Integrated Softphone

If your system admin has assigned a pascom softphone to your user account (default yes), then you can select your pascom softphone via the telephony settings menu.

![Softphone](softphone_audio.en.png?width=250px "pascom Softphone Audio Settings")

To use the softphone, you will need to configure the following softphone settings; Microphone, Speaker (Audio output) and Ringing speaker. Even if your desktop client has automatically detected your headset, you will need to select it from the drop down list. Should your headset not automatically appear in the list, then please check your computers audio.

## Choose a Location

You have the option of using the location function to use preconfigured setups, e.g. Home office PC with hardware telephone. If an administrator gives you the rights to log in and out of such a workspace, you can easily apply this setup to your user.


![Choose a location](workspace.en.png?width=500px)


You select one of the locations assigned to you and can now use the preconfigured telephone setup. This setting can also be found again in the Follow Me Settings of the Client Settings.

## Making Calls

### Training Video

{{< youtube xATkFu9Qizk >}}
  
Before you starting making calls, please check your telephone settings. Particularly if you have multiple telephones assigned to your user account, it is essential to ensure that the correct device is selected.

![Dialpad](dialpad.en.png?width=100% "pascom SIP Softphone")

### Start a Call

The desktop app offers numerous options for starting a call:

* Enter the number via the [Dialpad]({{< relref "#making-calls">}}).
* Call a colleague by clicking on the phone icon within the [Contact List]({{< relref "#contacts">}}).
* Click on the phone icon in the [Call History]({{< relref "#call-history">}}).
* Select a number from the [Phone Book]({{< relref "#phone-book">}}).

### Active Call

![Active Call](current_call.en.png?width=90%)

### Inbound Calls

![Inbound Calls](inbound_call.en.png?width=90%)

### Transfer

#### Blind Transfer (Unattended Transfer)

![Blind Transfer](blind_transfer.en.png?width=100%)

A blind or unattended transfer is a transfer of a call from one party to another without talking to the new contact during the transfer. A blind transfer can be performed at anytime during a call by clicking on the 'Transfer' icon and dialing the new destination number (number to which the call should be transferred).

If you wish to transfer the call to an internal colleague, simply right click on the desired colleague's name / profile picture in the contact list and select *Transfer* from the menu.

#### Attended Transfer

An attended transfer is a call transfer that involves speaking to the intended recipient before completing the transfer. To perform an attended transfer, please follow these steps:

1. Click *Add Participant*, to talk to the new party.
2. Now *Transfer* the caller with the newly added participant.

![Attended Transfer](attended_transfer.en.png?width=100%)

It is not necessary to place the caller on hold, as this is automatically done when the call to the new participant in step 1 is started either via the *Add Participant* button, the contact list, the phone book or via the call history logs. After completing step 2, the caller will be connected to the new party.


### 3-Way-Conferencing

![3-way-conferencing](3_way_conference.en.png)

A 3-way-conference is started in a similar fashion to an [Attended Transfer](/clients/client-user-guide/#attended-transfer) via a 2 step process.

1. Click the *Add Participant* button and call the required party.
2. To start a 3-way-conference simply click on the *Conference* button.

During a 3-way-conference call it is possible for the initiator to remove a party from the conference directly from the active calls list in the telephony section of the desktop app.

### Sending DTMF Tones

DTMF tones are used to enter information via the dialpad such as PIN authentication for conference rooms or when selecting the required choice in an IVR options menu (press 1 for..., 2 for ..., 3 for ... etc) or even having to enter a number code to open an intercom door for example.

For the pascom Client to send DTMF tones, the pascom softphone is required and the DTMF tones can be sent during a call via the *Dialpad*.

![DTMF](dtmf.en.png?width=500px)

## Search and Smart Filter

### Search

The pascom desktop client includes an extensive search tool which can be accessed via the search / magnifying glass icon. When searching, the search tool will search your internal contacts, all connected phone books, your call history and chat archive. The search term can consist of multiple terms / words.

![pascom client search](search.en.png)

*Example*: when searching for the contact *"Max-Andreas Mustermann"* the search term *"And Muster"* is sufficient.  

The search function can also be used in the dialpad to quickly find contacts for conferences or transfers.

![Search within dialpad](search_dialpad.en.png?width=250px)

### Smart Filter

Smart-Filters are a great tool to quickly filter your contact list for specific attributes or status, for example, who is currently online or just showing my favorites.

![Smartfilter](smartfilter.en.png?width=250px)

## Notifications

As soon as an event (call, message etc) occurs a popup notification will appear. These popup notifications provide additional information to the type of event i.e. caller name or chat contact name. The popups also allow users to react to the event without needing to go to the desktop client.

|Notification|Description|
|---|---|
|![Active Call](notification_outbound_call.en.png)|Popup indicating an active outbound call with the ability to end the call by clicking on the hangup icon.|

### Chat Notifications

Should the chat window not currently be active and you receive a new message, a green notifier will appear in the contact list next to the respective group / contact AND within your profile picture. The notifier within your profile picture represents all unread messages from all contacts / groups. Contacts with new messages will automatically move up to the top of the contact list, if you have set the list sorting to "recent".

The Client Settings > {{< ui-button "PDF to FAX settings" >}} allows you to define a folder on your computer. This folder is monitored by the client. As soon as a PDF File is saved, copied or printed in this folder, the pascom client opens the fax dialog to send this file.

### Automatic fax via a watched folder

Fax control panels are inserted as plain text in the document to be sent, then the fax server processes these instructions.

#### Preparation

To be able to recognize the panels from the PDF document, the [Ghostskript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) is needed on your machine. If the ghostscript is installed then the path of the Ghostscript File *gs* must be selected via the client > {{< ui-button "PDF to FAX settings" >}}.


#### Automatic transmission

Insert the controls into the document to be sent.

Please note that these panels can also be read by the recipient. Possibly, you can be invisible with certain writing programs (eg white test on a white background).

|Available controls||
|---|---|
|@@+FAX:+49991123456789@@|The fax must contain at least this control character with the destination number.|
|@@+TAG:Bestellung XYZ@@|Optionally, the fax job can be provided with a subject.|
|@@+NOTIFY:mustermann@musterfirma.de@@|Optionally, you can specify who should be notified of the status of the fax job.|


As described in the previous section, you can use the client settings > {{< ui-button "PDF to FAX settings" >}} to define a folder on your computer that is monitored by the client. As soon as a PDF file is saved, copied or printed in this folder, the control fields are evaluated and the file is sent as a fax.
