### Transfer

#### Blind Transfer (Unattended Transfer)

![Blind Transfer](blind_transfer.en.png?width=100%)

A blind or unattended transfer is a transfer of a call from one party to another without talking to the new contact during the transfer. A blind transfer can be performed at anytime during a call by clicking on the 'Transfer' icon and dialing the new destination number (number to which the call should be transferred).

If you wish to transfer the call to an internal colleague, simply right click on the desired colleague's name / profile picture in the contact list and select *Transfer* from the menu.

#### Attended Transfer

An attended transfer is a call transfer that involves speaking to the intended recipient before completing the transfer. To perform an attended transfer, please follow these steps:

1. Click *Add Participant*, to talk to the new party.
2. Now *Transfer* the caller with the newly added participant.

![Attended Transfer](attended_transfer.en.png?width=100%)

It is not necessary to place the caller on hold, as this is automatically done when the call to the new participant in step 1 is started either via the *Add Participant* button, the contact list, the phone book or via the call history logs. After completing step 2, the caller will be connected to the new party.


### 3-Way-Conferencing

![3-way-conferencing](3_way_conference.en.png)

A 3-way-conference is started in a similar fashion to an [Attended Transfer](#attended-transfer) via a 2 step process.

1. Click the *Add Participant* button and call the required party.
2. To start a 3-way-conference simply click on the *Conference* button.

During a 3-way-conference call it is possible for the initiator to remove a party from the conference directly from the active calls list in the telephony section of the desktop app.

### Sending DTMF Tones

DTMF tones are used to enter information via the dialpad such as PIN authentication for conference rooms or when selecting the required choice in an IVR options menu (press 1 for..., 2 for ..., 3 for ... etc) or even having to enter a number code to open an intercom door for example.

For the pascom Client to send DTMF tones, the pascom softphone is required and the DTMF tones can be sent during a call via the *Dialpad*.

## Search and Smart Filter

### Search

The pascom desktop client includes an extensive search tool which can be accessed via the search / magnifying glass icon. When searching, the search tool will search your internal contacts, all connected phone books, your call history and chat archive. The search term can consist of multiple terms / words.

![pascom client search](search.en.png)

*Example*: when searching for the contact *"Max-Andreas Mustermann"* the search term *"And Muster"* is sufficient.  

The search function can also be used in the dialpad to quickly find contacts for conferences or transfers.

![Search within dialpad](search_dialpad.en.png?width=250px)
