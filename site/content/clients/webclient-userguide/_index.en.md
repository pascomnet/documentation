![Overview](webclient_overview.en.png?)


## Prepare the pascom Group

Groups in pascom can quickly and dynamically create a place where people can communicate with each other. pascom groups can be used for a wide variety of scenarios, such as projects, presentations and conferences. Imagine pascom groups like virtual conference rooms.

### Create a pascom Group

First you need a group. Create a new group using the following [Instructions]({{< ref "clients/desktop-userguide#groups">}}). Tip: You can create as many groups as you like on the pascom system.

### Make pascom Groups public

In order to grant external participants access to a group, the group must be made public. The **info symbol** of a group takes you to the administration settings. Switch the **Allow guests** button **on**. The group is now public. This is also shown in the contact list for the respective group.


![pulic groups](groups_public.en.PNG?width=70%)

You now receive a **dial-in number, PIN and URL** for the web client.


|Fields|Description|
|---|---|
|Dial-in-Number|Participants can take part in the conference by phone via the WebClient by dialing the dial-in number.|
|PIN|The PIN is required to participate in the conference using the dial-in number.|
|URL|Link to the group in the web client.|
|Copy Invitation to Clipboard| Copy all details clearly to the clipboard to share all important data with external participants.|

{{% notice tip %}}
As soon as a group is public, external participants can log in to the group using the dial-in data. But don't panic, only moderators can actually start web conferences.

## The Moderator

Internal users of the pascom system are referred as moderators. Every internal user who participates in a public conference is also a moderator. If a moderator dials into a public conference, it starts for all externally logged in participants. If the last moderator leaves a public conference, the conference is set to **hold**.
As soon as external participants log into a conference and wait for the conference to start, you will see this in the contact list for the relevant group. The group will then turn green.

{{% notice tip %}}
Several internal users can also participate in a web conference, all of them then act as moderators. Hold a presentation and let another users answer questions in the chat at the same time.

### Start a Web Conference

As soon as you are ready to start the web conference, join the group by dialing in with the **handset symbol**. 

### Manage a Web Conference

As a moderator, you have full control over the conference. In the call area you can see all participants in the conference and can interact with them. You still have all the phone and video tools you need to give great online meetings or presentations. 


![participants](participant_list.en.PNG?width=80%)

You can still use the chat function with all participants and manage settings for the group.

You can remove individual participants from the conference using the **info symbol** of the group. Simply click on the **trash symbol** of the participant you want to remove. The conference is then ended for this participant.

### Close a Web Conference

You have the option of ending a conference at different points in the desktop or mobile client. In the content or call area, click on the **red handset symbol** to leave the conference.

The web conference is not completely ended. External participants are directed to a waiting screen. So after a short break you can restart the web conference again.

## The Web Client

The pascom Web Client offers the same conference functions as the pascom Desktop or Mobile Client. Video telephony, screen sharing and chat functions can be used via your favorite web browser.

### Participate in a Web Conference

As an external participant in a web conference, you will usually receive invitation data, that can look like this.

```
Group: "Demo Gruppe"
Webclient URL: https://pascom.net/pascom/webclient/f791b39a-4fd4-431b-850a
Dial in Number: +499912969166
PIN: 313 787 136

```
Surf to the web client URL with your browser and you will get to the start page of the web client.

Enter a name with which you want to participate in the web conference. This name will also be shown to all other participants. 

### The Web Client Options

**Choose Video**  

Your browser will automatically find installed webcams to participate in the web conference via video. Of course you can also deactivate the video function via the **DropDown menu**. 

**Audio through the Browser**  

Set the audio for the microphone and speakers here. The browser finds all installed devices such as, integrated components, headsets and headphones. Simply select your preferred end devices from the **DropDown menu**.

**Audio through the Phone**  

Change the tabs from browser to **Phone** to join the web conference by phone. Here you need the **dial-in number** and **PIN** to receive the audio via your phone.

### The Waiting Area

The waiting area always appears when no moderator has started the web conference or has chosen to pause from the conference.

![Webclient Wating Area](webclient_waiting.en.PNG?width=60%)

External participants can hear the music on hold set in the pascom system for the duration of their stay. The **Exit symbol** takes you back to the Web Client options.

### The Web Client Interface

As soon as the web conference has started, you will be taken to the web client interface, where you as a participant can use several options.

![Webclient GUI](webclient.PNG?width=100%)

**Video Areas enlarge/reduce**  

Each video area can be enlarged with a click and brought into focus. Click again to reduce the size. This is particularly helpful if you e.g. want to see more details in the screen sharing video.

**Participant List**  

On the right-hand side you will find the menu for the participant list, which you can show or hide. Here you will find all participants in the web conference.

**Toolbar**  

In the lower area you will find the toolbar. Here you can activate/deactivate your **microphone**, activate/deactivate **video sharing**, switch to **fullscreen mode** and leave the conference.
