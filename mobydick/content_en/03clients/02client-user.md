Apart from the search area, all areas of the mobydick client can be identified by the small gear symbol. Through using the gear symbol, settings can be modified or set for the corresponding section of the mobydick  CTI Client.

### mobydick Mini Mode
The mobydick Client can now be operated using 2 different views; full mode and the so called mini-mode. Mini-mode is particularly useful when you need to save space on your desktop, as it will only display the contact list. 

Switching between the 2 modes is achieved very simply through clicking the double arrow symbols << , which is located next to the contacts and teams tabs.

## Your Profile

### Overview
![Screenshot - Your Profile](../../images/client_main_profile.png?width=80% "Your Profile")

In the top left corner, you will find your User Info, which will display the following Information:

1. **Names & Extension** The Extension will be automatically configured according to the Telephone System and can the only be altered by the Administrator. 
You can change your name yourself, should you want to by using the following **"Settings" ----> "My Account"**.
2. **Your Profile Picture** (also know as an Avatar) including your **User Status**: the user status is indicated according the colour of the frame surrounding the Profile Pic. This can also be changed under "Personal User Settings". You can also change your Profile Picture under **"Settings" ----> "My Account"**. The appropriate How To can be found under: Changing User Password, Telephone PIN and Avatar
3. **Status Indicator:** You can change your status at any time and either enter a desired text, which will then be saved for later use, or you can use one of the predetermine Stati as listed under the "Personal User Settings" menu button.  
4. **Location:** This function displays the location where you are currently logged into mobydick. This is an important feature, should you need for example to change between HomeOffice and your actual Office. With locations, the setup is such that the telephones themselves are assigned to the Location, meaning that should you be logged into your HomOffice, your HomeOffice phone will ring and not your desk phone in the CompanyOffice.
     



## Journal
The mobydick client call journal records and logs all incoming and outgoing calls 
![Screenshot - Journal](../../images/client_main_journal.png?width=80% "phone journal")

The green telephone symbol (contained in the red box in the above graphic) provides with a direct call back function.


## Settings Tab

### Connecting and Using Telephone Books
The mobydick Client offers you the option of connecting more than just the internal Company Telephone Book. Moreover, depending on your wishes, the order in which the Telephone / Address books are searched and then displayed by the Client can also be altered, for example whether the mobydick Telephone Book or your personal Apple / Outlook address book should be searched first. 

{{% notice note %}}
Should you connect either of your Apple or Outlook Address books, you do not need to worry about whether or not your colleagues can see your private entries - They can't as your address books will only be displayed within your Client.
