The mobydick cloudstack is highly scalable in that it is possible to operate anything from a single mobydick instance up to thousands of instances. Depending on your setup, the minimum setup requirements will differ according to the number of instances in operation. This guide is intended for admins who operate a single or smaller number of mobydick instances.

## System Requirements

You can install and operate the mobydick cloudstack directly on x86 hardware or in a virtual machine.

Currently, the following Hyper Visors are supported:

+ VMWare ESX

### Determining RAM Requirements

The limiting factor regarding a cloudstack installation is normally not the system CPU or Disk Space but rather the RAM.

The RAM requirements can be determined as follows:

> **2048 MB** System + **512 MB** x No. of mobydick instances + **512 MB** x No. of proxies

In this simple setup guide, we will only require one proxy. Should you then wish to start & operate a maximum of five mobydick instances, then you will require:

> 2048 MB System + 512 MB x **5** + 512 MB x 1 = **5.120 MB RAM**

{{% notice tip %}}
The **512 MB RAM** pro mobydick instance is an average (perhaps conservative) **guideline**. This may vary according to the type and scope of your instances, number of users etc.

### Network Preparation

![Example Setup Network](/cloudstack_installation_simple-setup_external_ip.png)

In principle the cloudstack can have its own individual IP address and security settings as can every Proxy.

In our simple setup, we have limited ourselves to one Proxy and a single internal IP address for the whole system. External access will be directed to the cloudstack via Port-Forwarding (DNAT).

#### IP Addresses

You will need any internal IP address as well as a public IP address in order to connect users via the internet.

The public IP address should be a static IP address or accessible via dynamic DNS entry.

#### Firewall Adjustments

On the following ports, the external IP address (e.g. 81.27.56.23)  must be forwarded to the internal IP address (e.g. 192.168.0.10):

| Port | Description |
| ---- | ------------ |
| TCP **8884**  | IP Telephone provisioning |
| TCP **5222** | mobydick Desktop and Mobile Client access |
| TCP **5061** | SIP-TLS - secure SIP Communication |
| UDP **30000 - 35000** | SRTP - encrypted voice data |
| TCP **443** | mobydick instances management UIs (if required) |

## Installation

### Installation Media

The official current cloudstack ISO is available to download from the download section of our homepage.

Should you wish to operate the cloudstack from within a virtual machine, you can use the ISO file directly as the installation media.

In order to install on an x86 Hardware, generate an installations CD/DVD or USB stick from the ISO file.

### Setup Process

Boot your machine using the installations media.

During the setup process, please follow the on-screen instructions.

#### Network

Enter your local network settings and IP address. Later, every cloudstack component will be reachable from this IP address.

#### Disk Space
{{% notice warning %}}
During the setup process, the cloudstack will delete all the data stored on the named hard disk!
{{% /notice %}}

### Initialisation

The setup process will end after rebooting and you will be able to continue with the initialisation of the web User Interface.

Access is granted via `https` and the port `8443`. This is also indicated in the cloudstack welcome screen. For example, in our setup:

```
Welcome to the mobydick cloudstack

In order to access the web UI, please visit https://192.168.0.10:8443
```

Enter the URL `https://192.168.0.10:8443` (Change IP address accordingly)
in your browser search bar.

#### Certificates

{{% notice tip %}}
As long as you are not able to install any official certificates within the cloudstack, your browser will classify the connection as unsafe. Depending on your browser, you will be able to add an exception. For the simple setup, no official certificates are necessary.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Admin User

The cloudstack will now ask you to enter the `admin` password. The
`admin` credentials can be used both for accessing the cloudstack web UI as well as logging in per SSH.

#### 1st mobydick Instance

In addition to the first Proxy, the assistant will also add the first mobydick instance for you. As the instance name, we suggest your company name or that of your first customer.

The instance name will later become a component of the URL providing access to this mobydick instance (e. g. `https://192.168.0.10/instancename`) and is also required by end users in order to login to the mobydick client
(e. g. `username@instancename`).

The instance name is also visible to every users and therefore should be selected with care, particularly as it is not possible to alter the instance name at a later date. However, you will be able to delete the instance and add a new instance and import your old instance data using the backup mechanism.

Later on you will be able to add more instances.

#### Completing the Initialisation

As soon as the assistant has finished, you will be redirected to the login screen where you will be able to login in using the `admin` user than you just created.

## cloudstack Components

The cloudstack has a wide range of components available. These were pre configured (parametrised) during the setup and can be adjusted later. This section provides a necessary overview as well as providing examples to clarify and explain the complete concept in more detail.

### Management Web UI

```
https://192.168.0.10:8443
```
The cloudstack management UI is reachable via the Port `8443` and per default is available on all IP addresses which are connected to physical network cards

In the norm, your customers should not be able to access the management Web UI.
Further to this, the management UI serves as a platform from which you can manage mobydick instances, Proxies and backups as well as updating all services and instances.

### mobydick Instances

Every customer will be assigned with their very own mobydick instance, meaning it is possible to imagine the instances as tenants.

The advantage over traditional Cloud Solutions is that with the mobydick cloudstack each customer instance is isolated from other instances and can therefore operate their individual mobydick regardless of version or customisations.

Every customer can access the mobydick instance management UI via the following link (Port `443`):

```
https://192.168.0.10/instancename
```

The access to an instance will then automatically routed over a Proxy and can be regulated there.

### Telephony Services

A customers IP telephones (regardless of hard or software based) will be directly registered with appropriate mobydick instance per SIP. The complete communication process is done via a Proxy and can therefore be regulated there.

Per default, only encrypted connections are permitted:

| Port | Description |
| ---- | ------------ |
| TCP **5061** | SIP-TLS - secure SIP communication |
| UDP **30000 - 35000** | SRTP - encrypted voice data |

## Testing

The setup is now complete and the cloudstack is ready for operation. The following tests can help you in getting to know the cloudstack in more detail as well as helping validate your network configuration.

### Accessing the 1st mobydick Instance

With the URL `https://192.168.0.10/instancename` you should be able to access the mobydick web UI of the 1st mobydick instance. Simply login using the username `admin` and the password `mobydick`.

#### Changing the Admin Password

By every newly created instance, an admin user is automatically added.
Use this opportunity to change the `admin` password for this instance.

To do this is, simply select the menu options `Users > User List` then select the `admin` user and enter a new password.

After saving, an entry will appear in the Task List (Job Box - top of screen) prompting you to apply new telephony settings. Start the job by clicking on the `green tick` (Apply).

#### Adding Users

For additional tests, you will need to add two new users. The new users will automatically have a mobydick software assigned to them which the users can then use via the mobydick desktop client.

#### Apply Jobs

After saving, an entry will appear in the Task List (Job Box - top of screen) prompting you to apply new telephony settings. Start the job by clicking on the `green tick` (Apply).

### mobydick Client Tests

Log out of the mobydick instance and in the login screen you will find the **Service** menu tab under which you can download the mobydick desktop client for Windows,
Mac or Linux. Simply download and install the clients you require.

#### User Login

After the installation, start the mobydick desktop client. You will now be required to enter the following information:

| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Username | username@mobydick-instancename | jbarton@pascom |
| Password | The user's password | ****** |
| Server | DNS Name of Proxy | 192.168.0.10 |

Repeat this process for the second user by using a second workstation.

#### Audio-Hardware Configuration

Within the mobydick client, go to the menu option `Settings > mobydick Softphone` and
configure your audio hardware accordingly. If necessary, connect a headset to your computer.

#### First Phone Call

Within the mobydick client, you should now be able to see the other user(s) in the contact list. By clicking on the green handset, you will start calling that user enabling you to test your audio connection.

### IP Telephone Provisioning Tests

mobydick is in the position to automatically and securely configure IP telephones from the following manufacturers; Snom, Yealink and Auerswald.

#### Adding Telephones

Log back into the required mobydick instance and navigate to the menu option `Devices >
Device List`. You will now be able to add a new IP telephone here. Enter the telephones MAC address and save your new settings.

#### Copy the Provisioning URL

Select the phone and then choose the menu option `Actions > Provisioning URL`.
The system will now list the provisioning URLs for every proxy, e.g.:
```
https://192.168.0.10:8884/p/xJyj5_l9R0s6OlOZh36GcY1ximO0x6qLa9UjVulaxYI=+
```

#### Entering the Provisioning URL on a Phone

{{% notice tip %}}
If you have not installed an official certificate within the cloudstack, then your telephone will likely classify the connection as unsafe (e.g. Yealink phones). Most telephones have a setting to trust every certificate.
{{% /notice %}}

Surf to the Telephone Web UI and then enter the URL under the correct setting. The telephone should now reboot and will only be available to this mobydick instance.

After the successful provisioning, you should be able to see the exact model of the telephone within the device list and now you will be able to assign this device to a user.
