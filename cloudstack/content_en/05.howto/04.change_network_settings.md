{{% notice tip %}}
The following does not apply to Proxy Instances which have the **Network mode** set to `manual`. These are managed in the cloudstack Management UI Network Settings mask.
{{% /notice %}}

During the initial setup, you will configure your first network card (eth0) settings. For future changes, procees as follows:

### SSH Access to the cloudstack

First log into the your cloudstack per SSH using the **same password as for the
Management-UI**:

    ssh admin@mobydick.example.com

become the root user:

    sudo -s

and enter the password:

    [sudo] password for admin:

### Change Network Settings

In order to update the IP-Address, Netmask or Gateway of the first netmask (eth0), you need to edit the following file:

    vi /etc/network/interfaces

and change the corresponding settings within:

{{% notice warning %}}
Change **only** the settings on **eth0**. Do not add any further network cards as these are directly managed via the cloudstack Management-UI!
{{% /notice %}}

```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback


auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.0.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.0.254
```

Next, copy the file into the cloudstack's persistent storage:

    cp /etc/network/interfaces /persistent/etc/network/interfaces

and reboot the system:

    reboot

### Changing DNS Settings

In order to change the DNS server used by the cloudstack, edit the following file:

    vi /etc/dnsmasq.d/20externaldns

and modify the **server** entry accordingly:

```
# forward everything else to real nameservers
server = 192.168.0.254
```

Next, copy the file into the cloudstack's persistent storage:

    cp /etc/dnsmasq.d/20externaldns /persistent/etc/dnsmasq.d/20externaldns

and reboot the system:

    reboot
